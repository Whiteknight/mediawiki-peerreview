== About ==

The PageReviews extension is a MediaWiki extension under development which
allows class groups to use a Wiki as a more traditional learning environment.
Each page can be assigned an optional owner, or a list of owners. This
corresponds to how studens are given particular assignments in a traditional
classroom. Students edit their pages and are able to leave reviews on the pages
of others.

Each review consists of a numerical ranking and a short text comment.

== Installation ==

=== Prerequisites ===

You need jQuery. This extension does not supply jQuery itself. This extension
will not run properly without jQuery.

=== Install Steps ===

1) Make sure all prerequisites are installed properly.
2) Setup the SQL tables. Depending on your user credentials and database name,
   this incantation might work for you:

    mysql -u root -p wikidb < tables.sql

3) Setup the review scores in the Database. Again, depending on your credentials
   and database, this incantation might work:

    mysql -u root -p wikidb < reviews4.sql

4) Copy all contents of the repository, except the .sql files, to the
   /extension/PeerReview directory in your wiki installation.
5) Add this line to your LocalSettings.php:

    include_once( "$IP/extensions/PeerReview/PeerReview.php" );
