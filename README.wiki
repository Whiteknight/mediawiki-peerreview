== About ==

The PageReviews extension is a MediaWiki extension under development which
allows class groups to use a Wiki as a more traditional learning environment.
Each page can be assigned an optional owner, or a list of owners. This
corresponds to how studens are given particular assignments in a traditional
classroom. Students edit their pages and are able to leave reviews on the pages
of others.

Each review consists of a numerical ranking and a short text comment.
